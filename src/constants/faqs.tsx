    question: "What does a 'Pashword' even mean?",
    Answer: (
      <>
        Pashword means a hashed password. Pashword uses the concept of hashing
        to calculate a unique password for your account.
        <br /> Password + Hash = Pashword.

  {
    question: "Why should I use Pashword?",
    Answer: (
      <>
        3 Reasons:
        <br /> 1. The passwords most people use, are extremely weak and easy to
        hack in case of a data breach.
        <br />
        <br /> 2. Most people keep the same password for all their accounts.
        This is a dangerous practice, in case your account ever gets hacked,
        consider all your other accounts compromised.
        <br />
        <br /> 3. If you keep different passwords for different accounts, you're
        more than likely to forget them.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Pashword solves every single problem listed above,</b> without
        increasing any complexity in the password generation process.

    question: "What happens when I enter the details?",
    Answer: (
      <>
        Once you enter the details like the website, the username and secret
        key, Pashword's algorithm combines your details, hashes
        (one-way-encryption) them and then encodes them into a cryptographically
        strong password.
        <br />
        <br /> All of this takes place on your computer and no remote servers
        are contacted during this process. Your data stays on your computer. You
        can take a look at the source code on{" "}

  {
    question: "Will Pashword always generate the same password?",
    Answer: (
      <>
        Pashword uses your input to calculate a strong password. This pashword
        will always be the same as long as the input you provide remains the
        same but when you change even one variable, like the website or
        username, the pashword will change, hence giving all your accounts a
        unique password.
        <br />
        <br /> But that doesn't mean you can't generate a different password for
        the same account later on. All you need to do is change your secret key
        or add a number in front of your username to get another totally unique
        Pashword for the same account.

    question: "What's the 'Pashword Length' option for?",
    Answer: (
      <>
        Some websites with horrible security practices don't let you set
        passwords of certain lengths. They'd ask you to only set a password less
        than 12 characters long, which is kinda absurd but it is what it is.
        <br />
        <br />
        To combat this problem, Pashword provides you with a Pashword Length
        option. The small length is 11 characters. Medium is 15 characters and
        Large is 20 characters. You should always use the recommended Large
        length, except for when not possible.

    question: "Why does my screen freeze for a sec when I press the button?",
    Answer: (
      <>
        Pashword uses cryptographically secure hashing algorithms called Scrypt
        and SHA3-512. These algorithms are made to avoid bruteforce attacks so
        even hackers with world-class resources are going to have a hard time
        cracking your passwords.
        <br />
        <br />
        So when you press the 'Get Pashword' button, your screen will freeze
        because the calculations being done by your device are very complex,
        hence it takes some time for the device to generate the pashword. I know
        it can be annoying, but it's a security measure, better freeze than
        hacked ðŸ˜‰

    question: "What if the website doesn't accept my password?",
    Answer: (
      <>
        Ideally you'd want to let the website owners know their security is as
        good as a pasta. Did that make sense? No. Just like their password
        requirements.
        <br />
        <br />
        But fret not, when your password doesn't work, click the 'Not Working?'
        button underneath the green Pashword button. Here you can mention the
        website requirements and get a modified pashword in realtime. You can
        mention a max length and whether the password requirement allows symbols
        or numbers.
        <br />
        <br />
        Just as easily, you can submit the requirements of the website to me so
        I can build a database of website requirements. Once I do that, the next
        time you generate your pashword, Pashword will automatically detect the
        website and apply the requirements accordingly. No more headaches ðŸ¥³

    question: "What if my account gets breached and hashes get leaked?",
    Answer: (
      <>
        Since Pashword generates the same password for the same input, it poses
        a problem of changing passwords in rare cases like data breach.
        <br />
        <br />
        I must admit that this is certainly a disadvantage when using hashed
        passwords. The only solution in this case is to change your secret key
        and generate a new pashword. So now you have 2 secret keys to remember
        at most.
        <br />
        <br /> It's certainly not ideal and can be annoying, but this is
        something you wouldn't have to do very often. Even if the hackers have
        your password hash, it would take them several years to centuries to
        even crack the hash using bruteforce.

  {
    question: "What if hackers find out my secret key?",
    Answer: (
      <>
        If you're following the instructions given for secret key input, then
        there's no chance that a hacker could use bruteforce to find out your
        secret key. It's still technically possible, I cannot lie to you, but
        the possibility requires them to have a bunch of super-computers, at
        which point even the military wouldn't be able to save you.
        <br />
        <br />
        Pashword uses Scrypt + SHA3 algorithm to generate passwords so it
        protects you from bruteforce attacks by ASICs. ASICs are extremely
        expensive and for someone to invent an ASIC exclusively for Pashword
        would require thousands of dollars in resources and a leaked database of
        your account and even then, it's improbable that they're going to crack
        your secret key in a few years.
        <br />
        <br /> If you have a strong secret key, you have absolutely nothing to
        worry about. I'm saying this because I use Pashword myself and my secret
        key is strong enough to protect me from hackers, hopefully yours is too
        as long as Pashword shows it's green.

    question: "So, is Pashword a password manager?",
    Answer: (
      <>
        No not at all. Password managers require a database, most do not work
        without the internet due to sync ability and also let you store multiple
        passwords for multiple websites.
        <br />
        <br />
        Pashword is a hashed password generator. It doesn't store your passwords
        in a database, it calculates them according to the input you give to it.
        Kinda like a math equation:
        <span className="block rounded-md bg-slate-800 px-1 text-center">
          Website + Username + Secret = Pashword
        </span>
        <br />
        <br /> Since pashword calculates everything mathematically, it doesn't
        know who you are or what accounts you have. It just knows how to
        generate the password for an input you give to it.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "I already use a password manager, should I use Pashword?",
    Answer: (
      <>
        You should use password if:
        <br /> 1. You use the same password everywhere.
        <br /> 2. You often forget passwords.
        <br /> 3. You do not know how to use a password manager.
        <br />
        4. You do not want to use a password manager.
        <br /> 5. You want access to all your passwords even when you don't have
        internet or password manager access.
        <br />
        <br /> 6. You do not want to waste time coming up with strong passwords
        for every single one of your accounts separately.
        <br />
        7. You want your computer to handle it for you without requiring too
        much maintenance.
        <br />
        <br />
        You don't need Pashword if you're someone who keeps their database of
        password manager close at all times, someone who uses extremely strong
        and unique passwords for all their accounts or someone who always has
        access to the interent and multi-device sync.
        <br />
        <br /> You can use Pashword in conjuction with a password manager, where
        you can let your password manager store different secret keys for you in
        case of a database breach. Now that's what I call double protection.
